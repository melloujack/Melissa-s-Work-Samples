<h1 align="center">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h1>



## General

**Q: What is CAM?**

A: The **Customer Agreement Module** is an application within the Program Support Center (PSC) *WorkSmarter* platform developed as the enterprise solution for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service and Supply Fund (SSF) and each of the budget offices to centralize the location of all customer agreements and supporting documentation. Additional CAM impacts include:

- Standardize the approval process.
- Improve the reporting data transparency.
- Facilitate the billing process by establishing projects in PSC's Revenue Invoicing and Cost System (PRICES).
- Manage SSF activities to make sure customers are not over billed.
- Ensure data integration sending and retrieving invoices to/from PRICES.
- Receive the invoice collected amounts from the Department's financial system (UFMS) to provide the SSF activities a status on which customer invoices have, or have not, been collected.
- Allow each of the SSF budget offices to quickly assess the status of their budget authority while providing transparency and accountability into each activity's line of business.
- Improve the customer experience.

**Q: Where is CAM located?**

A: CAM is an application hosted on the PSC WorkSmarter platform. The URL for this website is <https://worksmarter.appiancloud.com>.

**Q: What is the contact information for the CAM Help Desk?**

A: The WorkSmarter Help Desk provides assistance for the CAM application. You can contact them by submitting a ticket via Help Desk within WorkSmarter, by calling 301-492-4555, or by emailing <worksmarter@psc.hhs.gov>.

**Q: How do I receive access to CAM?**

A: Contact the WorkSmarter Help Desk and let them know if you will be entering agreements/orders (as an Agreement Specialist), approving agreements (as a Budget Office Approver) or if you will be a read-only user for a servicing ability or budget office. Providing the help desk a user name from a similar role will assist in determining your access needs.

**Q: How often does CAM interface with PRICES?**

A: The CAM > PRICES transmission process is a manual process at this point, performed by the WorkSmarter Operations and Maintenance (O&M) team. Feeder files to establish PRICES projects for CAM records are usually transmitted once a week, and right before the billing period closes at the end of each month.

**Q: Which types of agreements and orders should be entered in CAM?**

A: Any agreement/order where the SSF activity is the servicing agency/service provider and the customer agency is not able to use G-invoicing for their Interagency Agreements (IAAs). ALL intrafund agreements (agreement where both the service provider and the buyer are members of the SSF) must be processed via CAM.

Do **NOT** enter agreements or orders in CAM if your SSF activity is the customer or requesting agency.

**Q: Does CAM capture information from the 7600As or only the 7600Bs?**

A: For orders against non-intrafund agreements, most information captured in CAM comes from the 7600B. There are a few data fields pulled from the 7600A. A previously signed, fully executed 7600A must be uploaded for every non-Intrafund agreement for record-keeping purposes.

**Q: Does CAM have the ability to track 7600Bs to a particular 7600A to make sure agreements do not exceed the 7600A?**

A: Currently, the Budget Office has the responsibility to track and make sure 7600B does not exceed 7600A.

**Q: Can CAM data be exported or sent to another system?**

A: The various CAM reports can all be exported to a spreadsheet format. There are currently no APIs that allow other systems to connect to CAM to retrieve data.

**Q: Are there CAM user guides and videos available on how to use application?**

A: Yes. The CAM User Guide and other resource documents are available with the "Supporting Documents" section of the app. On-demand training videos on how to create and approve an agreement have been posted to the PSC WorkSmarter channel in Microsoft Stream.

**Q: Can customer users or signers access CAM to input data or edit PDFs?**

A: This is not available at this time. The CAM team is exploring options for customers to submit data in CAM before signing in DocuSign.

## For Agreement Specialists

**Q: In the "Attachments" tab, what occurs if I select the "Yes" check box in the "Send to Customer" section?**

A: Once the budget office approves the agreement/order, all documents marked "Send to Customer" will be emailed to the contacts listed on the Points of Contact tab.

**Q: Who is required to use DocuSign?**

A: All SSF member servicing activities must use DocuSign for signatures, as mandated since FY22.

**Q: Have the customer signers been informed of this DocuSign process?**

A: The WorkSmarter O&M Team did not inform customer signers about this process. When an agreement/order is sent for signatures, CAM automatically emails the signing contacts, notifying them that DocuSign will be used. The Agreement Specialist must confirm the customer can sign this way.

**Q: How can I see which actions are pending signatures?**

A: Go to the Agreements tab and filter for records in "Out for Signatures" or "Pending Budget Office Approval" status. Open a record to view an attachment’s signing history.

**Q: In which order are signatures requested and received?**

A: The documents are sent to signatories in the following order:

1. Requesting Agency Program Official
2. Requesting Agency Funding Official
3. Servicing Agency Program Official
4. Servicing Agency Funding Official

A signer will **NOT** receive the email from DocuSign until the previous signer has signed.

**Q: What if the customer wants others to review the agreement first?**

A: The first email to all Points of Contact includes all attachments/supporting documents.
The customer should:

1. Forward the documents to any required reviewers before the Requesting Agency Officials sign.
2. Forward the DocuSign email to reviewers with clear instructions: **"Review only—do not sign."**

**Q: My customer does not want to use DocuSign. What can I do?**

A: Contact the SSF Fund Manager's Office.

**Q: What is the DocuSign email address that sends the emails?**

A: The emails are sent by *dse_NA4@docusign.net*. Customers should add this address to their safe senders list. Email clients may display the sender either as "DocuSign via DocuSign" or "WorkSmarter via DocuSign".

**Q: Where is the "How to Sign with DocuSign" guide?**

A: This guide is located on the CAM main page as well as the CAM user guide and FAQs.

**Q: My customers are not receiving the DocuSign emails. Can we resend them?**

A: To resend emails, contact the WorkSmarter Help Desk. While they can track when DocuSign sends emails, they cannot confirm delivery to the recipient's inbox.

**Q: My customer needs to reassign a routed attachment to a different signer. How is this done?**

A: When customers receive the DocuSign email and click to view the document, they can select "Reassign". This allows them to enter the email address of the new signer. After the new signer completes their part, the document automatically moves to the next signer in the workflow.

**Q: What do I do when one of my signers is OOO and unavailable to reassign the document to a different signer?**

A: Steps to Update Signer When Original is Unavailable:

1. Recall the Agreement/Order – Withdraw the current document from the signing process.
2. Upload a New PDF – For non-intrafund orders only, update the PDF with the correct signer details.
3. Update Points of Contact (POCs) – Replace the unavailable signer with an active one.
4. Re-route for Signatures – Resubmit the record.

**Q: Can customers make changes to the forms when they sign?**

A: While customers cannot modify pre-existing data on the form, they are able to add supplemental information such as new text entries, checkmarks in designated boxes, or the current date. This functionality closely mirrors the "Fill & Sign" feature in Adobe Acrobat/Reader for straightforward document interaction.

**Q: Can signers sign with their government PIV/CAC?**

A: Signing with a government-issued PIV or DOD CAC (Common Access Card) is not supported at this time.

**Q: Will my signers receive reminders when they need to sign?**

A: DocuSign will automatically email signers every 2 days when a document is awaiting their signature. After 90 days, the document expires and must be re-routed.

**Q: How do I know when my project has been established in PRICES?**

A: Any records in *Final* status has been established as a project in PRICES. Notifications are also sent with the list of your records that have been finalized the previous day.

**Q: Should I create a record in CAM for agreements or orders where my SSF activity is the customer?**

A: No. Only agreements and orders where the SSF activity is providing the services should be entered in CAM.

**Q: My customers have already signed the order. Should I resend the order to them via CAM and DocuSign for their signature?**

A: Contact the WorkSmarter Help Desk to discuss. All signatures should be obtained via DocuSign, which was mandated in FY22.

**Q: How do I request a new PRICES customer to be added to CAM?**

A: CAM utilizes the same customer database as PRICES, meaning all customers must first be established in PRICES before becoming available in CAM. To add a new customer, please submit the standard PRICES Customer Request form to PRICES@psc.gov as you've done previously. After PRICES processes the request, the customer record will automatically populate in CAM. If needed, you may request a blank copy of the form from the PRICES team.

**Q: I am trying to create a new agreement/order record, but the cost center providing services is not listed as an option. How can I request it to be added to CAM?**

A: Contact the WorkSmarter Help Desk on 301-492-4555 or submit a ticket via the Help Desk module on the WorkSmarter website with the cost center number and name. It can be added quickly to CAM.

**Q: What if my POCs are not listed when I search for them in CAM?**

A: Below the POC fields is a link to create a new POC in the CAM database. After adding your POC, you’ll be able to search for that POC and add it to the agreement record.

**Q: How do I delete or cancel an agreement/order or modification?**

A: To delete a record in Draft status, navigate to the Related Actions tab for that record. This action is permanent and irreversible. For finalized agreements/orders, cancellation requires creating a modification with the "Cancel Agreement" option selected in the Reason for Modification field, then routing it through the standard approval process. If the record has not yet been finalized but cannot be deleted (e.g., pending submission), contact the WorkSmarter Help Desk for assistance.

**Q: How do I know which TAS (Treasury Account Symbol) to select in CAM?**

A: The TAS field must be entered in CAM exactly as it appears on the 7600B form. Pay close attention to the ATA and AID fields, as multiple agencies may share the same MAIN number. Ensure you select the TAS that aligns with the correct ATA/AID combination. Note that if the selected TAS's AID doesn't match the PRICES customer's AID, the project cannot be established in PRICES. In such cases, you must either correct the TAS or create a new PRICES customer with the matching AID.

**My customer does not provide their Obligating Document Number (ODN) until after they receive the fully executed order. What should I enter before I route for signatures?**

A: ODNs are not required prior to budget office approval. Leave the ODN fields blank – you can edit the ODNs after the budget office has approved the agreement. Do NOT enter a placeholder. **NOTE: An ODN is required on non-intrafund agreements before the project can be established in PRICES. The SSF terms and conditions stipulate that the ODN must be provided within 10 days of agreement execution or the end of the month, whichever comes first.**

**Q: My agreement/order has been approved by the budget office, but I need to change some data. How can I do this?**

A: If your agreement/order is in Final status, it has already been sent to PRICES as a new project. In this case, you must modify your agreement to make your changes. If the agreement/order is not yet in Final status, click Edit Agreement to make changes that do not require Budget Office approval, including the PRICES customer, TAS, ODNs, and description. To change the amounts or the dates, click “Recall Agreement” to move the record back to Draft status. Afterwards, re-route the record to acquire new signatures. **NOTE: Recalling a document will notify all signers that the document has been recalled, and the agreement/order will need to be re-routed for signatures.**

**Q: How do I correct an ODN after a record has been finalized?**

A: Create a modification in CAM and select “No New Funding – ODN Correction” as the “Reason for Modification.” You will not be required to upload new documents or route the record for signatures.

**Q: I need to modify an agreement/order from a prior year. Should that be done in CAM?**

A: Many pre-existing agreements from prior years have been migrated from PRICES to CAM, with CAM agreement numbers matching their original PRICES project numbers. These agreements can be modified directly in CAM like any other agreement record.

If you cannot locate your agreement in CAM or if it was never established as a PRICES project, please contact the WorkSmarter Help Desk for assistance. For additional guidance, consult the help document *“Deobligating Pre-CAM Agreements and Orders v20220613”* located on the CAM Main tab.

**Q: How is CAM impacted by G-Invoicing?**

A: G-Invoicing is a U.S. Department of the Treasury platform that manages Interagency Agreements (IAAs), including General Terms and Conditions (GT&Cs) and associated orders. As of FY24, the SSF has adopted G-Invoicing for all new non-intrafund agreements and orders, which must now be entered, routed, and approved through this system.

*Exceptions Processed via CAM:*

- Intrafund agreements
- Non-intrafund orders where the customer agency hasn't yet implemented G-Invoicing
- Modifications to all pre-FY24 agreements and orders (including non-intrafund), as these legacy records remain in CAM

**NOTE: Pre-FY24 non-intrafund agreements were not migrated to G-Invoicing, so all modifications must continue through CAM.**

## For Budget Office Approvers

**Q: I received a notification for an agreement/order that requires approval. How do I approve the record?**

A: Approval Process in CAM:

1. Access CAM
	- Click the link in the approval email to log in.
2. Review and Sign Documents
	- Sign each document that requires your approval.
3. Finalize Approval
	- After signing all documents, click the “Enter Decision on Agreement” button to approve the record in CAM.
4. Completion
	- The fully executed agreement/order will automatically be sent to all Points of Contact (POCs).

**Q: For documents requiring signature approval, am I required to print, sign, and upload the approved document into CAM? Or can I download the PDF, sign it with my PIV, then re-upload it?**

A: Digital Signing Process in CAM:

1. Access the Document
	- Click *Continue* in the top banner.
2. Before Signing
	- Click *Start* in the document view, or scroll to the signature section.
3. Apply Your Signature
	- Select *Sign* in the DocuSign interface. Your digital signature will be inserted automatically.
4. Complete the Process
	- Click *Finish* in the top banner to save the signed document back to CAM.

**Q: When I attempt to sign an attachment, I am receiving a message saying that my attachment needs to be processed. What does this mean?**

A: CAM automatically converts unsupported PDF attachments to a DocuSign-compatible format, typically within 5 to 10 minutes. You will receive an email notification when the conversion is complete, at which point you can proceed with signing the document. If you do not receive the email notification or encounter any errors, please contact the WorkSmarter Help Desk for assistance.

The conversion process requires no action on your part and ensures the document can be properly signed through DocuSign. If the document remains unavailable after the expected time frame, the Help Desk can investigate further.
